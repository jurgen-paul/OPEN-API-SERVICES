# Overview

Evaluate the accuracy of the model-generated answer based on the 
Copernicus Product Security Policy and an example answer. The response 
should align with the policy, cover key details, and avoid speculative 
or fabricated claims.

Always respond with a single floating point number 0 through 1,
using the grading criteria below.

## Grading Criteria:
- **1.0**: The model answer is fully aligned with the policy and factually correct.
- **0.75**: The model answer is mostly correct but has minor omissions or slight rewording that does not change meaning.
- **0.5**: The model answer is partially correct but lacks key details or contains speculative statements.
- **0.25**: The model answer is significantly inaccurate or missing important information.
- **0.0**: The model answer is completely incorrect, hallucinates policy details, or is irrelevant.

## Copernicus Product Security Policy

### Introduction
Protecting customer data is a top priority for Copernicus. Our platform is designed with industry-standard security and compliance measures to ensure data integrity, privacy, and reliability.

### Data Classification
Copernicus safeguards customer data, which includes prompts, responses, file uploads, user preferences, and authentication configurations. Metadata, such as user IDs, organization IDs, IP addresses, and device details, is collected for security purposes and stored securely for monitoring and analytics.

### Data Management
Copernicus utilizes cloud-based storage with strong encryption (AES-256) and strict access controls. Data is logically segregated to ensure confidentiality and access is restricted to authorized personnel only. Conversations and other customer data are never used for model training.

### Data Retention
Customer data is retained only for providing core functionalities like conversation history and team collaboration. Customers can configure data retention periods, and deleted content is removed from our system within 30 days.

### User Authentication & Access Control
Users authenticate via Single Sign-On (SSO) using an Identity Provider (IdP). Roles include Account Owner, Admin, and Standard Member, each with defined permissions. User provisioning can be automated through SCIM integration.

### Compliance & Security Monitoring
- **Compliance API**: Logs interactions, enabling data export and deletion.
- **Audit Logging**: Ensures transparency for security audits.
- **HIPAA Support**: Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) available for customers needing healthcare compliance.
- **Security Monitoring**: 24/7 monitoring for threats and suspicious activity.
- **Incident Response**: A dedicated security team follows strict protocols for handling incidents.

### Infrastructure Security
- **Access Controls**: Role-based authentication with multi-factor security.
- **Source Code Security**: Controlled code access with mandatory reviews before deployment.
- **Network Security**: Web application firewalls and strict ingress/egress controls to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Physical Security**: Data centers have controlled access, surveillance, and environmental risk management.

### Bug Bounty Program
Security researchers are encouraged to report vulnerabilities through our Bug Bounty Program for responsible disclosure and rewards.

### Compliance & Certifications
Copernicus maintains compliance with industry standards, including SOC 2 and GDPR. Customers can access security reports and documentation via our Security Portal.

### Conclusion
Copernicus prioritizes security, privacy, and compliance. For inquiries, contact your account representative or visit our Security Portal.

## Examples

### Example 1: GDPR Compliance
**Reference Answer**: 'Copernicus maintains compliance with industry standards, including SOC 2 and GDPR. Customers can access security reports and documentation via our Security Portal.'

**Model Answer 1**: 'Yes, Copernicus is GDPR compliant and provides compliance documentation via the Security Portal.' 
**Score: 1.0** (fully correct)

**Model Answer 2**: 'Yes, Copernicus follows GDPR standards.'
**Score: 0.75** (mostly correct but lacks detail about compliance reports)

**Model Answer 3**: 'Copernicus may comply with GDPR but does not provide documentation.'
**Score: 0.5** (partially correct, speculative about compliance reports)

**Model Answer 4**: 'Copernicus does not follow GDPR standards.'
**Score: 0.0** (factually incorrect)

### Example 2: Encryption in Transit
**Reference Answer**: 'The Copernicus Product Security Policy states that data is stored with strong encryption (AES-256) and that network security measures include web application firewalls and strict ingress/egress controls. However, the policy does not explicitly mention encryption of data in transit (e.g., TLS encryption). A review is needed to confirm whether data transmission is encrypted.'

**Model Answer 1**: 'Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256, but a review is needed to confirm encryption in transit.'
**Score: 1.0** (fully correct)

**Model Answer 2**: 'Yes, Copernicus encrypts data in transit and at rest.'
**Score: 0.5** (partially correct, assumes transit encryption without confirmation)

**Model Answer 3**: 'All data is protected with encryption.'
**Score: 0.25** (vague and lacks clarity on encryption specifics)

**Model Answer 4**: 'Data is not encrypted in transit.'
**Score: 0.0** (factually incorrect)
